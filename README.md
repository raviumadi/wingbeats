# Wingbeat-Call Asynchrony Simulation and Theory

This repository provides the full simulation code, analysis scripts, and supporting functions used in the study of **Temporal Precision** built on the **Responsivity Framework** in echolocating bats. It contains modules to explore the temporal dynamics of sonar call timing, wingbeat coordination, and sensory feedback loops in echolocating animals.

This code supports the following manuscripts:

1. [*Biosonar Responsivity Sets the Stage for the Terminal Buzz* ](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.16.659925v1) 
2. [*Temporal Precision Necessitates Wingbeat-Call Asynchrony in Actively Echolocating Bats*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.18.660328v1)  
3. [*Swarm Cohesion in Bats Emerges from Stable Temporal Loops*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.05.663265v1)
