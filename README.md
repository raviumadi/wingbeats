# Wingbeat-Call Asynchrony Simulation and Theory

This repository provides the full simulation code, analysis scripts, and supporting functions used in the study of **Temporal Feasibility** built on the **Responsivity Framework** in echolocating bats. It contains modules to explore the temporal dynamics of sonar call timing, wingbeat coordination, and sensory feedback loops in echolocating animals.

This code supports the following manuscripts:

1. [*Biosonar Responsivity Sets the Stage for the Terminal Buzz* ](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.16.659925) 
2. [*Temporal Feasibility Constraints on Wingbeat-Call Synchrony in Actively Echolocating Bats*](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.18.660328)  
3. [*Swarm Cohesion in Bats Emerges from Stable Temporal Loops*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.05.663265v1)

- `airAttenuationFilter.m`, `calculateTargetStrength.m`, `calculateGeometricAttenuation.m`, etc. – physical modelling of sound propagation  
- `formatLatex*.m` – visual formatting for plots with LaTeX labels  

### `/mat`  
Simulation entry points and experiments scripts:

- `wingbeat_sim.m`, `wingbeat_sim_loop.m` – test cases and multi-run simulations for wingbeat–call synchrony  
- `sim_rand_var_run.m` – Monte Carlo simulations with randomly sampled biological parameters  
- `ssg_demo.m` – sonar sound group simulation demo  
- `supplementary_analysis.m` – statistical and graphical analyses for paper figures  
- `temporal_integrity.m` – analysis of call–echo timing fidelity
